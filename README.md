# Theme Name

## Features

Styling is handled by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Dependencies
Go Version 1.18

## Installation

1. Init project as a hugo module with `hugo mod init {name of repo}`. Ex: `hugo mod init github.com/carpentries/my-project`
2. Add the theme to your project using modules as such:

```yaml
# hugo.yaml
# Imports the theme into the projects
module:
  imports:
    - path: github.com/carpentries/carpentries-hugo-theme
  mounts:
  - source: layouts
    target: layouts
  - source: assets
    target: assets
  - source: archetypes
    target: archetypes
  - source: hugo_stats.json
    target: assets/watching/hugo_stats.json
# Make sure Tailwind 3 will work on `hugo serve`
build:
  writeStats: true
  buildStats:
    disableClasses: false
    disableIDs: false
    disableTags: false
    enable: false
  cachebusters:
    - source: assets/watching/hugo_stats\.json
      target: styles\.css
    - source: (postcss|tailwind)\.config\.js
      target: css
    - source: assets/.*\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)
      target: js
    - source: assets/.*\.(.*)$
      target: $1
```

2. run `hugo mod npm pack`. This will generate the necessary `package.json` with the theme's dependencies.
3. run `npm install`
4. run `hugo serve` to navigate your project locally


## Maintenance

### Maintain theme on your local machine

To locally work on theme one should go into the project‚Äôs own `go.mod` file and add this line at the end:

```diff
module github.com/theNewDynamic/carpentries-project

go 1.18

require github.com/carpentries/carpentries-hugo-theme v0.0.0-20240530145900-caf8617804d0 // indirect

++ replace github.com/carpentries/carpentries-hugo-theme => /Users/username/path/to/dir/carpentries-hugo-theme
```

This will use your local directory on the project instead of the remote module. Now this is ok but you have to be careful not to commit this. Or

1. It will fail on everyone else machine including CI
2. We will look like amateurs ü§™

There is an other solution documented [here](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-configuration-top-level) under ‚Äúreplacements‚Äù.

### Syncing the project with latest theme

Once theme changes have been pushed to the theme's repo, one need to make sure the project runs the latest version of the theme.

1. To do that one needs to go the project‚Äôs directory, and run from there the following:

    ```diff
    hugo mod get -u github.com/carpentries/carpentries-hugo-theme
    ```

    This should update the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

2. Changes to those two files can now safely be commited
